## Tips on getting started

The steps shown here use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), but every other Python package manager will work too.

- First, create a virtual environment with `uv venv .venv` or similar, maybe you have to source it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
- Next, install maturin for building the Python package with `uv tool install maturin`.
- Now, you can build the crate and install it as a Python module into the current venv with `maturin develop`
- For perfomance testing, you can compile the code optimized with `maturin develop --release`.
